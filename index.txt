working with trees of data
==========================

Two kinds of trees:

*   arbitrarilly deep and self-referential

    Reddit comments work like this.  I can comment on a post, you can
    reply to me, and I can reply, and on and on.

    File-system folders work like this too.

*   Fixed-depth trees

    Biological taxonomy is a good example.  Every organism fits in to
    this hierarchy:

    Domain, Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species



Rendering results
=================

*   JSON
*   CSV
*   XML


Compute moving averages

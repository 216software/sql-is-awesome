Fun with parking spaces
=======================

Find nearby vacant spots
------------------------

::

    select *
    from garages g

    -- only grab spots not reserved during this time
    where not exists (
        select *
        from reservations r
        where (r.start, r.end) overlaps (%(start)s, %(end)s)
    )

    -- grab spots within 500 meters
    and st_dwithin(g.position, %(user position)s, 500)

    order by st_distance(g.position, %(user position)s)
    limit 100

Another example of query plan magic
-----------------------------------

We could grab all nearby spots and filter to those that were not
reserved, or grab all not-reserved spots, and filter to those nearby.

The query plan looks at the selectivity of the two where clauses to
figure out which to run first.

Figuring out pricing was the most fun
--------------------------------------

Each garage had their own price rules, for example:

*   Arrive 8 AM to 8 PM and pay $10
*   Arrive after 8 PM until 8 AM and pay $5

*   But if there's a baseball game that night, the night time price goes
    to $20, starting at 4 PM.

*   If I have 10 spots, when I'm down to the last two, the price doubles

This part was tricky :)

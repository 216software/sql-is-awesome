Find qualified nurses for an open shift
=======================================

Shifts have different requirements
----------------------------------

The day shift has these requirements

*   RN
*   involves care for dementia patients
*   requires a nurse manager

But the night nurse shift only needs these:

*   LPN
*   involves care for dementia patients

Each nurse has his or her own list of credentials, e.g. nurse Matt:

*   LPN
*   can handle dementia patients

Make some tables
----------------

::

    create table credentials (
        title text primary key
    );

    create table shifts (
        title text primary key
    );


    create table shift_requirements (
        shift text not null references shifts (title),
        requirement text not null references credentials (title)
    );

    create table nurses (
        display_name text primary key
    );

    create table nurse_credentials (
        nurse text not null references nurses (display_name),
        credential text not null references credentials (title)
    );


Find candidates for the night shift
-----------------------------------

For each employee, count up the matching credentials that are in the set
of requirements for this shift::

    select nurse, count(*)
    from nurse_credentials
    join shift_requirements
    on nurse_credentials.credential = shift_requirements.requirement
    and shift_requirements.shift = 'night shift'
    group by 1;

Now count how many requirements this night shift has::

    select shift, count(*)
    from shift_requirements
    where shift = 'night shift'
    group by 1;


Join the two groups, keeping where the count matches::

    with a as (
        select nurse, count(*)
        from nurse_credentials
        join shift_requirements
        on nurse_credentials.credential = shift_requirements.requirement
        and shift_requirements.shift = 'night shift'
        group by 1

    ),

    b as (
        select shift, count(*)
        from shift_requirements
        where shift = 'night shift'
        group by 1
    )

    select b.shift, a.nurse
    from a
    join b
    on a.count = b.count;

For all shifts, find qualified workers
--------------------------------------

For every (nurse, shift) combination, figure out how many credentials
for that shift each nurse has::

    select nurse_credentials.nurse, shift_requirements.shift,
    count(*) as credentials_count

    from nurse_credentials

    join shift_requirements
    on nurse_credentials.credential = shift_requirements.requirement

    group by 1, 2;

    +-------+-------------+-------------------+
    | nurse |    shift    | credentials_count |
    +-------+-------------+-------------------+
    | Matt  | day shift   |                 1 |
    | Alice | day shift   |                 3 |
    | Bob   | day shift   |                 3 |
    | Bob   | night shift |                 1 |
    | Alice | night shift |                 2 |
    | Matt  | night shift |                 2 |
    +-------+-------------+-------------------+


Now count up how many credentials each shift needs::

    select nurse_credentials.nurse, shift_requirements.shift,
    count(*) as requirements_count

    from nurse_credentials
    join shift_requirements
    on nurse_credentials.credential = shift_requirements.requirement
    group by 1, 2;

    +-------+-------------+--------------------+
    | nurse |    shift    | requirements_count |
    +-------+-------------+--------------------+
    | Matt  | day shift   |                  1 |
    | Alice | day shift   |                  3 |
    | Bob   | day shift   |                  3 |
    | Bob   | night shift |                  1 |
    | Alice | night shift |                  2 |
    | Matt  | night shift |                  2 |
    +-------+-------------+--------------------+


Now, join the two, on the name of the shift, and when credentials_count
matches requirements_count::

    with a as (

        select nurse_credentials.nurse, shift_requirements.shift,
        count(*) as credentials_count

        from nurse_credentials
        join shift_requirements
        on nurse_credentials.credential = shift_requirements.requirement
        group by 1, 2

    ),

    b as (

        select shift_requirements.shift, count(*) as requirements_count
        from shift_requirements
        group by 1

    )

    select a.shift, a.nurse

    from a
    join b
    on a.shift = b.shift
    and a.credentials_count = b.requirements_count
    order by 1, 2
    ;

    +-------------+-------+
    |    shift    | nurse |
    +-------------+-------+
    | day shift   | Alice |
    | day shift   | Bob   |
    | night shift | Alice |
    | night shift | Matt  |
    +-------------+-------+

*   Ask for help!  I got this solution because somebody on
    thepostgresql-users mailing list told me about an old book called
    SQL Puzzles and Answers.

*   CTE's (the with stuff) make queries really easy to read

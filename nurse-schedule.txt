Find qualified nurses for an open shift
=======================================

Shifts have different requirements
----------------------------------

Each shift on a nursing home schedule has certain required attributes.  For
example, the 7 AM to 7 PM Monday shift needs a nurse with these credentials:

*   requires RN
*   involves care for dementia patients
*   requires a nurse manager

But the night nurse shift only needs these:

*   requires LPN
*   involves care for dementia patients

Each nurse has his or her own list of credentials.

Make some tables
----------------

::

    create table credentials (
        title text primary key
    );

    create table shifts (
        title text primary key
    );


    create table shift_requirements (
        shift text not null references shifts (title),
        requirement text not null references credentials (title)
    );

    create table nurses (
        display_name text primary key
    );

    create table nurse_credentials (
        nurse text not null references nurses (display_name),
        credential text not null references credentials (title)
    );


Find candidates for the night shift

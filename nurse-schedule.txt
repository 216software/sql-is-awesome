Find qualified nurses for an open shift
=======================================

Shifts have different requirements
----------------------------------

Each shift on a nursing home schedule has certain required attributes.  For
example, the 7 AM to 7 PM Monday shift needs a nurse with these credentials:

*   requires RN
*   involves care for dementia patients
*   requires a nurse manager

But the night nurse shift only needs these:

*   requires LPN
*   involves care for dementia patients

Each nurse has his or her own list of credentials.

Make some tables
----------------

For each employee, count up the matching credentials that are in the set of
requirements for this shift.
